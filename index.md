# About Matt

I’ve spent a lot of time in nature climbing walls, hiking mountains, and sleeping under the stars deep in the backcountry. Adventure, Exploration, and Storytelling have always been major aspects of my life, which is how I’ve now found myself trekking around in the vast world of Data Science. 

To me, data is much more than numbers and math. It’s an adventure where you get to explore large quantities of information, uncovering hidden insights and transforming that information into a story that everyone can understand. I’m well-versed in Operations Management, Business Analytics, Data Analysis, Data Visualization, Leading Cross-Functional Teams, Web Analytics, Behavioural Analytics, Experimental Design, and Utilizing Creativity.
